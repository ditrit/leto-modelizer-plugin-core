# Migrate from version 0.22.0 to x.x.x

## Update in `DefaultData`

- Add `baseFolder` in constructor:

```js
// Before:
new DefaultData({
  name: null,
  version: null,
  components: [],
  variables: [],
  definitions: {
    components: [],
    links: [],
  },
  parseErrors: [],
});

// After:
new DefaultData({
  name: null,
  version: null,
  components: [],
  variables: [],
  definitions: {
    components: [],
    links: [],
  },
  parseErrors: [],
  baseFolder: '/'
});
```

For now, we will use absolute path instead of relative path in our application. So the purpose of `baseFolder` is to allow leto-modelizer to define the application context in terms of files management. This means that all actions will be performed within this "base" folder.
