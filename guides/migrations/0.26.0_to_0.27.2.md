# Migrate from version 0.26.0 to 0.27.2

## Upgrade Node.js and npm

### Uninstall Previous Versions

Before installing the new versions, you need to remove any existing installations of Node.js and npm from your computer.

__On Linux:__

1. __Remove Node.js and npm__ (if installed via package manager):

```bash
sudo apt-get remove nodejs npm
```

2. __Check for any remaining files:__

```bash
which node
which npm
```

If any paths are returned, delete those files manually.

### Install the New Versions

Install the latest versions of Node.js and npm by following the instructions from the official Node.js documentation.

__Recommended Versions:__

* __Node.js:__ [v20.16.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.16.0)
* __npm:__ [v10.8.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm/v/10.8.1)

You can install these versions directly via nvm (Node Version Manager) for better flexibility:

1. __Install nvm (if not installed):__

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

2. __Install Node.js:__

```bash
nvm install 20.16.0
nvm use 20.16.0
```

3. __Update npm to the latest version:__

```bash
npm install -g npm@10.8.1
```

### Verify Installation

Ensure that the correct versions of Node.js and npm are installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

The output should be:

* Node.js: `v20.16.0`
* npm: `v10.8.1`

## Clean Up Your Dependencies
   
### Remove node_modules
   
To avoid any issues with outdated or incompatible dependencies, delete the existing node_modules directory:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```

### Install Dependencies

Reinstall the project's dependencies using the updated versions of Node.js and npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run Tests and Verify the Upgrade

After upgrading and installing dependencies, it's important to run your test suite to ensure everything works as expected.

```bash
npm test
```

Check the output to confirm that all tests pass successfully. If any issues arise, refer to the error messages or logs for troubleshooting.
